        High-Flying Mumbai City FC will play lackluster Bengaluru FC in their 7th game of the season at the Mumbai Football Arena. The stadium is sold out for the 2nd consecutive game as the fans are up for an
        entertaining battle between these two heavyweights.
        <br>
        <br />
        Mumbai City FC come into this game with a thumping 6-2 away win against Chennaiyin FC in their last game. Also, the Islanders are one of the two sides to remain unbeaten
        so far this season. Speaking ahead of the game, Mumbai Head Coach Des Buckingham spoke about his team's set-piece defending.<strong>"We need to focus on that. Out of the eight goals that we have conceded, six have been from set pieces. It's an area of concern"
        </strong>added 37-year old Englih Coach.

        before the start of ISL. Also, his side have scored the joint least number of goals so far this season (2 Goals). Addressing the media ahead of the game, Grayson added
        <strong>" I’m working extremely hard to correct things, to turn it around and I know I won’t be far away from doing that."</strong>

            <br />
            <strong>Greg Stewart</strong> will be the key player for the Islanders. The midfielder showed his quality once again in his last game against Chennaiyin FC. He has scored 2 goals and provided 4 assists in 6 games this season. His movement and creativity will
            be the key to breakdown the compact Bengaluru FC defense.

            <br>

            <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhtkedkUAAAnwwk?format=jpg&name=small" alt="" height=400px><br>
            <strong>Sunil Chhetri</strong> will be the most important player for the Blues. Having scored the least number of goals in the league, Grayson will rely on none other than veteran Sunil Chhetri to fix his team's scoring woes. Also, the Indian Captain will be
            hoping to open his scoring account in the ISL this season and help the Blues .
